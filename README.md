## The Issue
So, here’s the deal: We did some snooping around and discovered that many folks out there—yes, even savvy site owners—might be unknowingly rocking a not-so-legit version of our plugin. Yikes! 😱

**Scenario 1:** Picture this—a blissfully unaware user innocently installs a plugin, only to find out later that it’s like a virus-filled piñata. Not cool, right?

**Scenario 2:** Then there’s the case of well-meaning developers (the ones you hired to build your site) who might’ve slipped in a slightly sketchy version of our plugin. Oopsie!

## The Solution
Enter our trusty sidekick: wpAudit Plugin! 🦸‍ Its mission? To make sure your UnitedOver plugin(s) are squeaky clean, malware-free, and ready for action.

So go ahead, install it, give it a fist bump (or a virtual high-five), and rest easy knowing your site is rocking the real deal. No more shady surprises!

Stay safe out there, web warriors! 🛡️
